Skylight decodes ADS-B from a cheap RTL-SDR radio and renders the planes physically
flying over you onto a ceiling-pointed projector. A jet you'd hear overhead glides
across your ceiling at the same moment — labeled with its airline, type, and where it's
headed. Pure-black background so the projector's rectangle disappears and only the
aircraft (and stars) are lit.

It also draws the **real sky** behind the planes — sun, moon, bright stars and
constellations, and live **satellites including the ISS** — all at their true positions
for your location and time. Tune everything from your phone.

> Reference build is centered on **San Francisco International (SFO)**, but it works
> anywhere — set your coordinates (and swap the runway data) and you're flying.

## Features

- **Real-time overhead aircraft** from a local RTL-SDR (sub-second), or from a free web
  API with zero code changes — handy for trying it with no radio.
- **Type-aware glyphs** in a luminous, swept-wing style: widebodies tower over regional
  jets, **helicopters spin their rotors**, turboprops and GA aircraft spin their props.
- **Smooth motion** — interpolates the ~1 Hz fixes to 60 fps by rendering slightly in
  the past and tweening between real positions (no teleporting).
- **Comet trails**, altitude-graded color, and range rings + compass for orientation.
- **The airport** (runways) drawn at its true position, so you watch departures and
  arrivals line up with the runway.
- **Window to elsewhere** — each routed flight shows its destination **city, local time
  there, and miles-to-go**, plus a faint great-circle arc toward where it's headed.
- **Live sky layer** — sun, moon (with phase), bright stars + constellation lines, and
  **satellites / ISS** computed from TLEs. Scrub time forward/back from your phone, or
  jump straight to the next ISS pass.
- **Phone control panel** — every setting (rotation, theme, palette, filters, sky
  toggles, …) is live-tunable over your LAN and persists across reboots.
- **Appliance-ready** — boots straight to a full-screen kiosk on a Raspberry Pi 5.

## Hardware

| Part | Suggested | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Receiver | **RTL-SDR Blog V4 + dipole** | The included dipole is plenty — planes are nearly overhead. |
| Compute | **Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB)** | Decode + render. Active cooling for 24/7. |
| Projector | Short-throw laser (e.g. Optoma GT2100HDR) | Laser = deep blacks + safe to point up. Any 1080p projector works. |
| Display link | micro-HDMI → HDMI | The Pi 5 uses **micro**-HDMI (not mini). |
| Mount | Rotating 1/4-20 stand, pointed up | Lower the stand for a bigger image; tape **+ a safety tether**. |

You don't need any of this to try it — see Quick start.

## Quick start (local, no radio)

Runs entirely on your computer against a free public ADS-B API.

```bash
pnpm install
DATA_SOURCE=api pnpm dev
```

- **Display:** http://localhost:5173/
- **Control panel:** http://localhost:5173/control.html (or from your phone: `http://<your-ip>:5173/control.html`)

Set your location in the control panel area is coming; for now set `centerLat` /
`centerLon` in [`shared/src/config.ts`](shared/src/config.ts) (defaults to SFO).

### With a radio (locally)

```bash
scripts/install-rtlsdr-fedora.sh    # rtl-sdr-blog driver + blacklist DVB-T (Fedora; see script for Debian)
scripts/run-dump1090-local.sh       # decode + serve aircraft.json on :8080
DATA_SOURCE=radio pnpm dev
```

## Raspberry Pi appliance

Full walkthrough in [`pi-setup/README.md`](pi-setup/README.md): flash + headless
provision the SD card, install the driver + decoder + app, and set up the boot-to-kiosk
display. Once it's running, push updates from your dev machine with:

```bash
PI_HOST=skylight.local ./scripts/deploy-to-pi.sh
```

## Configuration

`Config` ([`shared/src/config.ts`](shared/src/config.ts)) is the single source of truth,
persisted to `server/data/config.json` and live-editable from the control panel. Key
fields:

| | |
|---|---|
| `centerLat` / `centerLon` | **Your location** — where you're looking up. |
| `radiusMiles` | How far out to show (default 3 — "what you could realistically see"). |
| `rotationDeg` / `mirrorX` | Calibration for the looking-up flip (tune against a real pass). |
| `theme` | `ambient` · `telemetry` · `focus`. |
| `showStars` / `showSun` / `showMoon` / `showSatellites` | Sky layer toggles. |
| `skyTimeOffsetMin` | Scrub the sky clock for testing (0 = live). |
| `showDestArc` / `showRouteDetail` | "Window to elsewhere". |

**Using it somewhere other than SFO:** set `centerLat`/`centerLon`, and replace the
runway geometry in [`web/src/display/airports.ts`](web/src/display/airports.ts) with your
local airport (coordinates from [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/data/)). Stars,
sun, moon, and satellites are computed for your coordinates automatically.

### Server environment

| Env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DATA_SOURCE` | `radio` | `radio` (dump1090) or `api` (airplanes.live) |
| `AIRCRAFT_JSON_URL` | `http://localhost:8080/aircraft.json` | dump1090 feed |
| `SUPPLEMENT_API` | `1` | When on radio, merge the API too (keeps landing aircraft alive) |
| `PORT` / `HOST` | `3000` / `0.0.0.0` | HTTP + WebSocket |

## Architecture

```
RTL-SDR ──USB──> dump1090-fa ──> aircraft.json (:8080)
                                      │ poll ~1 Hz  (+ API supplement)
                                      ▼
                         server/  (Node · Express · ws)
                         • normalize + enrich (airline/type tables + adsbdb routes)
                         • proxy satellite TLEs (Celestrak)
                         • persist config, broadcast over WebSocket
                         ├──────────────────────┬───────────────────────┐
                         ▼                      ▼                       ▼
                   Display (/)            Control (/control)        REST /api/*
                   canvas renderer +      phone settings UI
                   sky engine → projector (live, two-way)
```

- **`shared/`** — TypeScript types, config schema, and pure geo/projection math.
- **`server/`** — polls the radio (primary) and API (supplement), enriches aircraft,
  proxies TLEs, persists config, and pushes everything over a WebSocket.
- **`web/`** — Vite + React, two pages: the **display** (`<canvas>` renderer + celestial
  engine) and the mobile **control panel**.
